P10 for Phase 2
Make Something Beautiful.


SquirrelHQ is the official resource for all things students, at DBC. It is intended to be utilized by the SF Squirrels Cohort, and hopefully will be inherited by future Cohorts at DBC SF when they enter Week 3.

Squirrel HQ consists of three parts. Distractions, Productivity, and Remember to Eat.

DISTRACTIONS
Distractions consists of two parts, Squirrel Bingo a bingo game created for Passion Project B, which has squares that are instances of things that occur during a lecture, and "whatshouldwecall:DBC" a tumblr inspired gif page that takes GIFs with a caption below it.

A user can play bingo. A user can add a square that is relevant to events that happen in their respective cohorts lectures. A user can hide instances that are no longer relevant to their experience during lectures.


Anyone can view all the GIFs with captions. A user can add a GIF and caption. The captions are limited to 5 per page.


PRODUCTIVITY
Productivity allows a user to get back to work! Productivity will include a GitHub API that will easily allow them to access their projects. It will also include resources pertinent to topics across all the lectures. Finally it will allow a user to access the community DBC page for their respective cohort. This will allow them to see all posts that was made on google+.

REMEMBER TO EAT (STRETCH GOAL)
This will implement either a yelp or googlemap API that finds good food nearby with directions and reviews.  It will also implement a twilio API that will email the user and remind them to eat, potentially with a place they added to their restaurant.
